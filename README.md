# Attendance Management System
A simple web application used for managing the attendance of students that are registered in their respective events.

## Methodology
There are three modules:- 

•	Team Manager 

•	Team Leader 

•	Team Member 

The team manager creates events and gives access to the leaders to those particular events they are registered.

The team leaders have to login to their particular event using their credentials. Then they manage to have the list of the team members who are registered for their event. 

The members get registered to the event they like to and they have their login credentials to view the status of their attendance. A team member can register to more than one event. 

## Softwares used
•	Front End – HTML, CSS and Javascript 

•	Middleware – Servlets / JSP

•	Backend – Oracle 

• IDE – Eclipse 

•	Web server – Apache Tomcat 8
